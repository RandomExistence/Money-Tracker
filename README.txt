Money Tracker. For, well, tracking money.

You are given money daily(not yet changable, 250 Baht/day).
When you enter Money Tracker for the first time for each day, you'll be allowed money, else no.
You can add product name and price to the grid. You can also edit it. 
If you want to remove a product, leave price field blank or as 0

The info is kept in localStorage, so it's device-based.
History is not yet fully implemented and requires further testing.

This is my side project for practicing html, css and js. Also for fun and my own usage, ofc.
